The goal for this project is to get a robot to pick up a bone from th game Operation autonomausly. 
The robot can use any means to do so but it must start its operation not on top of the board. 
Cameras can be used to find the bone and can be placed above the board. 100 points for getting the bone out of the body part of the Operation guy.
